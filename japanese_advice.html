  <h2>Advice</h2>
  <p>Though I may not have been learning for too long, there are some key fundamentals that come with every language that help immensely. The things discussed will be frequency and length, accessibility, motivation, method. Though I can not guarantee this will apply to everyone since everyone has different learning styles, the vast majority of us may find something helpful from some of these tip since they are so broad and can be used for studying in general.</p>

<h2>Frequency and Length</h2>
Frequency and length refers to the amount of time put into Japanese and the number of times per given time period that Japanese is studied. For example someone will have a high frequency but low length when they study for 5 minutes each day. Objectively, studying with high frequency and high length is much better than cramming maybe 5 hours into 1 day. This way, the knowledge is retained and put into the long term memory. Not everyone has the time to spend maybe 3 hours each day studying, but frequency is better than length. Of course there are limits when you study for 20 seconds each day, but putting in 10 minutes each day is much better than 2 hours a week. Not only is it retained easier, but the studying will eventually become a habit and make motivation easier. </div>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
Accessibility is the availability of materials for study. If your book is open and ready for writing in, it's much easier to get started studying than if it was locked in a vault. Accessibility vastly effects motivation so having everything ready for you to study in makes keeping a consistency much easier. You'll see the resources laid out in front of you and you'll feel obligated to study. The same goes for things that will distract you. If you keep your phone next to you, you'll likely check every notification and get distracted regularly. Make sure distractions are far away.</div>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
Motivation is your will and desire to study. Motivation mostly becomes invisible once the action becomes a habit. To gain motivatio, you can put rewards for studying a certain amount of time or doing a certain amount of work. Conditioning yourself to feel good after doing a lot of work makes doing work easier. Make sure your motivation is not hindered by a lack of accessibility, negative comments from others or entertainment.</div>

<div id="main2">
<h2>Method</h2>
Everyone has a different method of learning and that is fine. There are some things that usually work for everyone though, as described above. Things like kanji should be written regularly to maintain knowledge of the meaning, stroke order, and reading. This is why Japanese in Japan is written so often. Vocabulary should be revised based on the trouble you have remembering the translation. Most importantly, if you feel you are not learning more efficiently than you were or as efficiently as you could, experiment and give new methods a try. Don't stick with something that doesn't release your potential.</div>
