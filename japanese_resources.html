  <p>Learning tools help accelerate the speed a language a learn. Below are some of my favourite sites to use to learn Japanese with one or a few reasons why. </p>

<div id="main2">
<h2>Jisho</h2>
<a href ="https://jisho.org/">Jisho</a> is a great online dictionary containing an unbelievable number of words. I love it because each verb is conjugated and classed. Each phrase is specified whether it is generally written in kana. The specificity of Jisho is amazing.

</div>

<br>

<div id="main2">
<h2>Romaji Dictionary</h2>
<a href ="http://www.romajidesu.com/">Romaji Dictionary</a> is a great dictionary as well and is comparable to Jisho but it does not have all the features. What it does have is a more concise layout, putting phrases such as "そうです" and "そうだ" together since they have the same meaning but a subtle difference in formality. Also, the romaji search is great as expected.

<div id="Resource">

</div>

<br>

<div id="main2">
<h2>Tofugu</h2>
<a href="https://www.tofugu.com/">Tofugu</a> contains many extremely easy lessons on essential grammar in the Japanese language. Not only that, but it provides more resources such as books for learners to improve their Japanese on. In my opinion, their grammar lessons are one of the easiest to understand on the web.

<img style = "width: 71.5vw; height: auto;" src = "Image/Japanese%20Stack%20Exchange.JPG">
</div>

<br>

<div id="main2">
<h2>Japanese Stack Exchange</h2>
<a href="https://japanese.stackexchange.com/">Japanese Stack Exchange</a> has a plentiful number of people asking niche questions that usually aren't explained in other websites. For example, the subreddit for Japanese learning typically will remove your question since a majority of questions are thought of as too easy to answer. Plus, anyone can ask and answer.
