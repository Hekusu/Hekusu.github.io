Congratulations on beginning your tough trip through the language of Japanese. It may seem extremely daunting at times, but you must not give up so that all the time you put into the language doesn't go to waste. Anyway, the title is a play on the word enjo meaning support, ii meaning good, and enjoy meaning just enjoy.
<br>
Japanese consists of a few main parts: <ol>
    <li>Vocabulary</li>
    <li>Reading</li>
    <li>Kanji and Other Kana</li>
    <li>Tone and Pronunciation</li>
    <li>Grammar</li>
    </ol>
    
Since I don't have the almost infinite space required to describe every kanji, word, grammar structure, and tone, the most I can provide you all with is some tips on how to study them, some resources, and all the particles you'll need. Language is something for everyone. If it wasn't, then you would not be reading this. I wish you the best of luck on this trip that you've started and hope that you make it all the way through.

Take all the information in this whole site with a grain of salt. Though this may seem like great advice, it's all coming from someone without any degrees and such. Just from someone who is currently learning Japanese and is sharing their knowledge.
